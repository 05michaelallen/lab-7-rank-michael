Michael says hello
Kirby says hi

if you are the collaborator:
- load tidyverse
-read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
- make some side-by-side histograms of the score.pre for all respondents, seperated by the gender column 

```{r}
#load relevant libraries and data

library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

hist_kermit <- 
  ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

hist_kermit
```
